.SH NAME
spirv-remap \- a utility to compress of SPIR-V binary files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B spirv\-remap
[\fI\,OPTION\/\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
spirv-remap is a utility to improve compression of SPIR-V binary files via
entropy reduction, plus optional stripping of debug information and
load/store optimization.  It transforms SPIR-V to SPIR-V, remapping IDs.  The
resulting modules have an increased ID range (IDs are not as tightly packed
around zero), but will compress better when multiple modules are compressed
together, since compressor's dictionary can find better cross module
commonality.

Remapping is accomplished via canonicalization.  Thus, modules can be
compressed one at a time with no loss of quality relative to operating on
many modules at once.  The command line tool operates on multiple modules
only in the trivial repetition sense, for ease of use.  The remapper API
only accepts a single module at a time.

spirv-remap is currently in an alpha state.  Although there are no known
remapping defects, it has only been exercised on one real world game shader
workload.
